## Installation and Usage
This application uses MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, and Insomnia.


After cloning the repository, you can open an integrated terminal, then run "npm install" to install the dependencies. Then, enter "npm run start" to initialize the server and database. Then you can use MongoDB and Insomnia to create, update and remove users. As well as create, update and remove thoughts. You can also search for thoughts or users by their generated id.

## General Info
This application was made to build an API for social network sites, where users can create an account, share thoughts, react to others thoughts, and add friends. So far, I am unfortunately unable to get the friends list functionality working. But hope to get that changed soon!
